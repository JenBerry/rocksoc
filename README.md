# Coding with Django

Hi there. I'm guessing you've landed here because you want to see evidence of my coding ability with Django.

This is a project I did back in 2008. It was my first forey into backend development and Python.

I've have a lot more experience since then, and hopefully I will have some more up to date code to share with you on github soon.

In the mean time this may give you an idea of my beginnings.

It was my task to update the code from an old developmental version of Django to version 1.0, and also the mySQL database along with it. I also designed and build a new front end for the site.
